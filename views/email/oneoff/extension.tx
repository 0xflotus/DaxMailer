<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">You've probably gathered by now that cobbling together an effective privacy solution has required researching complicated technologies, and installing multiple add-ons and apps on each device. Today we’re taking a major step to simplify online privacy with the launch of fully revamped versions of our browser extension and mobile app, designed so that you can easily get all the privacy essentials you need on any device with just one download. <img src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/emoji/duck2.png" alt="" style="max-height:20px;vertical-align:top;" /> <img src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/emoji/high-five.png" alt="" style="max-height:20px;vertical-align:top;" /></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">The DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app now has built-in tracker network blocking, smarter encryption, and, of course, private search – all designed to operate seamlessly together while you search and browse the web. We wanted to let you know that this update is now available across all major platforms – <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.duckduckgo.safari-HKE973VLUW">Safari</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-for-chrome/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id663592361?mt=8">iOS</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android">Android</a> – and if you already have it installed on a platform, it should auto-upgrade soon.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">Our new version will also now show you a Privacy Grade rating (A-F) when you visit a website. This rating lets you see at a glance how protected you are, dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you, and learn how we enhanced the underlying website's privacy measures.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">For the last decade, DuckDuckGo has been giving you the ability to search privately, but that privacy was only limited to our search box. Now, when you also use the DuckDuckGo browser extension or mobile app, we will provide you with seamless privacy protection on the websites you visit. While not all privacy protection can be as seamless, the essentials available today and those that we will be adding, will go a long way to protecting your privacy online, without compromising your Internet experience.</p>

We'd love it if you could share the #PrivacySimplified message on social media too, and help more people take back their privacy!</p>
