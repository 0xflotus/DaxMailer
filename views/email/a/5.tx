<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">In our last email, we showed how to delete your <a href="http://history.google.com/history">Google Search History</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">This limits the information that Google has to sell to advertisers. But, they likely still have an advertising profile on you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">We've mentioned before that as an advertising company Google has trackers on more than 2.2 million websites and 1 million apps. They collect information about you as you surf across the net and use this to compile your "Ad Settings."</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">This is really just a way for them to sell your profile of interests to advertisers for top dollar.</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Disable Ad Settings:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated">Ad Settings page</a></li>
<li>Scroll down, and toggle "Ads Based on Your Interest" to off<img src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/ads_interests5.png?atb=<: $subscriber.flow :>" style="max-width:500px" alt="Picture of setting ad interests to off"/></li>
<li>Then, scroll down more, and click the blue button to "opt-out of signed out ads." Turn off the toggles on that page too.&nbsp;<img src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/control_ads.png" style="max-width:400px" alt="Picture of setting logged out ad tracking to off"/></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">Tracking is creepy, but luckily, you've switched to the Duck Side, and so now your searches are completely anonymous. DuckDuckGo protects your search history from everyone -- even us! <img class="emoticon" src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/ghost.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></p>
