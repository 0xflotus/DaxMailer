  When was the last time you spoke with your friends or family about internet privacy? Sadly, for most people, the answer is <em>never</em>. In general, people believe that only a small percentage of people care about privacy, and while we know that isn't true, it is something that keeps most people from talking about privacy. <img src="https://duckduckgo.com/assets/email/emoji/dontspeak.png?atb=<: $subscriber.flow :>" style="height:24px;vertical-align:-7px;" alt="Monkey covering its mouth" />

A <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/privacy-goes-mainstream-93464a352c59">recent study we conducted</a> showed that people are <em>taking action</em> to protect their online privacy, for example 20% of respondents use tracker blocking add-ons or software, as well as other measures such as using DuckDuckGo.

  So maybe you didn't share DuckDuckGo because you thought no one would care? But, now that you know most people do, it is time to stand up and spread the word.
