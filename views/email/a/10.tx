  <b>Privacy Mythbusters #1:</b> <em>Nobody else cares about privacy!</em>
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">
  When was the last time you spoke with your friends or family about internet privacy? Sadly, for most people, the answer is <em>never</em>. In general, people believe that only a small percentage of people care about privacy, and while we know that isn't true, it is something that keeps most people from talking about privacy. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tS6GHzv.png" alt="Monkey covering its mouth" />

  In Jan 2017, the <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42253017">IDC found</a> that 84% of consumers expressed concern for their personal information, and 70% reported greater concern than just a few years ago.

  And it's not all talk. A recent study we conducted showed <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/privacy-goes-mainstream-93464a352c59">large numbers of people</a> are also taking privacy actions like installing add-ons that block trackers or using DuckDuckGo.

  So maybe you didn't share DuckDuckGo because you thought no one would care? But, now that you know most people do, it is time to stand up and spread the word.
