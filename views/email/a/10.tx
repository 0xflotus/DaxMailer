<em>We hope you enjoyed our first series of privacy tips. This email begins our second series about busting privacy myths!</em>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">
  When was the last time you spoke with your friends or family about internet privacy? Sadly, for most people the answer is never. In general, people believe that only a small percentage of people care about privacy, and while we know that isn't true, it is something that keeps most people from talking about privacy!

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">
  In Jan 2017, the <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42253017">IDC found</a> that 84% of consumers expressed concern for their personal information, and 70% reported greater concern than just a few years ago.

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">
  And it's not all talk. A recent study we conducted showed <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/privacy-goes-mainstream-93464a352c59">large numbers of people</a> are also taking privacy <em>actions</em> like installing add-ons that block trackers or using DuckDuckGo!
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">
  So maybe you didn't share DuckDuckGo because you thought no one would care? But, now that you know most people do, it is time to stand up and spread the word.
